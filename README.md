# Hacker.travel()
## A web application to make organizing travel logistics for hackathon organizers and attendees simple.

### Hackathon organizing is hard.
Between ensuring a seamless hacker experience, securing enough sponsorship to host a great event, and 
actually having the logistical backend to pull off the affair, the process can be cumbersome.

As organizers of a very special event called VandyHacks, we want to make our jobs easier so we can focus
on hosting the best hackathon possible. That being said, having to manually parse through travel reimbursements,
coordinate buses and other vehicles with the risk of human error making a mistake, and finding the time
to actually do all of this by hand is an incredible challenge we'd like to mitigate for ourselves
as we mature as event organizers.

### That's where Hacker.travel() comes in.
Hacker.travel() is a web application whose primary goal is to streamline the experience of organizing a hackathon.
Logistics is tough - it pertains to securing a venue, transporting attendees, and feeding lots of hungry
mouths. Hacker.travel() focused on the second task of the logistics team - actually getting attendees to the 
event.

### Okay, so how exactly do your attendees get there?
- Car - People can drive themselves if they have access to a vehicle.
- Bus - We send out buses to schools with many interested applicants.
- Flight - In some cases, we can fly attendees out for our event!

Coordinating all of this is tedious. Hacker.travel() offers an interface to let hackathon 
attendees make travel plans and hackathon organizers leave the heavy lifting of organizing
travel to the application and simply view what plans exist.

### Hacker.travel() does a few things.
- Given a starting location, figures out how much of a gas reimbursement an attendee can receive.
- Shows available flights, and lets attendees know how much of the ticket can be subsidized.

### How is TRVL built?
TRVL was built with love using Firebase, Express.js, and React.js at HackIllinois 2017.
